This project is a demo of a web app which will allow users to select animals in a zoo and combine them into a chimera.

Each animal is a representation of a cryptocurrency on the market, and pulls each cyrptocurrency's market data through from an API.

When users create their chimera, it is equivalent to an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) which is a combination of the underlying assets.

In this app, users can explore the zoo, view various animals (various cryptocurrencies), select them via a staking functionality,
and then go to the ETFX within the zoo to combine their selections into a chimera (ETF), at which point they recieve a textual description 
of the chimera they have created, generating by quierying a database of phrases that describe various weightings of various cryptocurrencies.

Currently, only the enclosure of Private Coins is populated with animals.
