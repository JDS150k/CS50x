                    <li>&#8220;Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity.<strong> Health promotion, therefore, should proactively support, nurture, reinforce, and develop environments to increase engagement in activities that enhance physical, mental, and social capacity</strong>&#8230; Traditional measures use a &#8216;loss frame&#8217; by measuring risks and problems. A &#8216;gain frame&#8217; associates good habits with beneficial outcomes&#8230; <strong>Traditional efforts have created defensive health promotion efforts to eliminate risk factors rather than proactively going on offense</strong> to enhance capacity-building, sustainable lifestyles.&#8221; &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319234955_Going_on_Offense_to_Enable_Health_Promotion_Gains" target="_blank">Going on Offense to Enable Health Promotion Gains,</a><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319234955_Going_on_Offense_to_Enable_Health_Promotion_Gains" target="_blank"> American Journal of Health Promotion</a></em>, September 2017</li>

                    <li>&#8220;<strong>Millennials are seeing their health decline faster than the previous generation</strong> as they age. This extends to both <strong>physical health conditions</strong>, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, and <strong>behavioral health conditions</strong>, such as major depression and hyperactivity. These accelerated declines will result in greater demand for treatment and <strong>higher healthcare costs&#8230; 33%</strong> higher than Gen-Xers experienced at a comparable age.

                    <li>&#8220;The <strong>significant superiority in both accuracy and activations</strong> for the Note group suggested that the use of a <strong>paper notebook</strong> promoted the acquisition of rich encoding information and/or spatial information of real papers and that this information could be utilized as effective retrieval clues, leading to higher activations in these specific regions.&#8221; &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.634158/full" target="_blank">Paper Notebooks vs. Mobile Devices: Brain Activation Differences During Memory Retrieval, <em>Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience</em>, March 2021</a></li>
